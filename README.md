# CIT3064-Web-Design-And-Scripting
All the work was done in my Web Design And Scripting Class at PLNU. I learned an in-depth, hands-on introduction to
designing and scripting Web sites using HTML5 and CSS3 standards. Techniques in page layout and graphic design. Assignments
focused on hands-on modern web development practices using integrated development environments. In addition, some
advanced topics such JavaScript programming was introduced and used in the final weeks of the class.
